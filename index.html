        <h1><span style="font-size: 0.8em;">the</span> Marketplace Manifesto</h1>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">Today's dominant marketplaces for digital goods are exploitative monopolies. Think of the google play store, apple app store, and Steam. They exploit their power for their own gain, to the detriment of merchant and customer alike. I have a dream of a future in which these marketplaces are overthrown and replaced by open alternatives. These are the principles by which they would operate:</p>
        <section>
            <h2>1. For merchants and customers, by merchants and customers</h2>
            <p>The marketplace should be operated and governed by an entity ('the operator') whose sole interest is the well-being of merchants and customers. In practice, this means that the marketplace should be operated by a non-profit.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>2. Transparency is key</h2>
            <p>In a marketplace for the people, by the people, transparency is paramount. The entire codebase should be open-source and all policies governing the marketplace should be clearly documented. Of course, the data of the merchants, including sales data, is protected as it is considered the property of the merchant.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>3. The operator owns the space, not the transaction</h2>
            <p>The operator owns, governs and maintains the marketplace, but has no ownership over the transactions. This means that transactions are directly performed between merchant and customer. The marketplace facilitates this transaction by offering the merchant the option to add their own payment methods.</p>
<p>Note: This does not necessarily mean that participation in the marketplace is free. Running a marketplace requires resources. As such, it is reasonable for merchants to pay a one-time or re-occurring fee for the right to operate their storefront and/or a fee for publishing a product.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>4. Open does not mean lawless</h2>
            <p>Communities work better under clear rules prohibiting undesired behavior. These rules are created in close collaboration with stakeholders. Actors breaking these rules are given a warning. Continued behavior results in removal.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>5. Exposure is not a commodity</h2>
            <p>All merchants should have an equal chance of getting exposure to customers. Exposure is never sold, so no ads or selling favorable search ranking. It is the duty of the operator to guide the customers to their desired product to the best of their ability. </p>
<p>This does not mean that the marketplace is prohibited from having a general storefront advertising certain products or merchants. It is reasonable to highlight the best (personalized) deals as this benefits merchant and customer alike. However, these spots are awarded based on merit, not because of a financial incentive for the operator.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h2>6. A sale in an agreement that transcends the marketplace</h2>
            <p>A transaction between a customer and a merchant should be valid beyond the marketplace. This means that if a product was purchased on a different marketplace, the purchase of that product should also be acknowledged in this marketplace.</p>
<p>Note that a very strict interpretation of the product is required. A digital product for one platform is not the same as that same product for another platform. The inclusion of a digital product as part of a subscription is not the same as the outright purchase of that product.</p>
